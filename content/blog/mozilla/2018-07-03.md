Since this is the end of the first half-year, I think it is a good time to
reflect and show some work I've been doing over the last few months, apart from
the regular batch of random issues, security bugs, reviews and the fixing of 24
bugs found by our [fuzzers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing).

## Bug 1319203: Make JS to WebAssembly calls *blazingly* fast

If we want more WebAssembly (wasm) adoption, there shouldn't be a big costly
barrier between the two universes. That is, calls from one world to the other
should be fast. For a very long time, calls from JS to asm.js/WebAssembly have
been quite slow in Firefox. In fact, we didn't optimize them at all. For ease
and speed of implementation at the time, asm.js call activations (data
structures recording information about the function being currently called in
the VM) were very different from the JS ones. This difference indicated some
significant structural differences, like the capability to reconstruct call
stack information used by `Error()` stack frames, or just tracing the stack for
garbage collection purposes. After putting a lot of hard work into refactoring
and low-level changes over the last year, Spidermonkey was finally ripe for an
optimization.

When we call from JS to asm.js/wasm, the call passes through C++, does a bunch of
work and then calls into a piece of glue code directly written in assembly: the
*interpreter entry stub*. This stub is quite small: it just copies out the C++
arguments into the right places the wasm function being called expects, sets up
some small machine state, calls into the function, then does error checking and
eventually returns to the C++ caller. The critical part is JIT compilation. JIT
compilation means that the code is compiled to machine code by the just-in-time
compiler, IonMonkey. When a JS function has been JIT-compiled and it calls into
wasm, then the caller would have to go back to C++ first, before the control
flow is redirected to WebAssembly.

Starting with Firefox 60, the JIT compiler makes no distinctions between
calling a JavaScript function or a WebAssembly function, meaning it uses the
same call optimizations for both kinds of function. A new piece of glue code,
the *JIT entry stub*, is generated for each exported function: it converts and
unboxes the arguments read from the JIT-compiled JS caller into the right
primitive types as expressed in the wasm function's signature, sets up some
machine registers, calls into the wasm function being called and then converts
the result into a format the JS caller will understand.

This resulted in massive speedups over a variety of different situations: when
a wasm function is directly / indirectly / polymorphically called, or used as a
getter/setter, or called by `Function.prototype.call/apply`, when the call is
missing required arguments, etc. Here's a brief summary of the results, but
there might be a full-blown blog post about these optimizations coming on
[Mozilla Hacks](https://hacks.mozilla.org/) at some point in the future.
(calling 1 billion times into very simple functions, lower is better)

This work is not entirely done yet: we can still even better optimize in the
case of a function call from JS when the called wasm function is definitely
known to be a unique wasm target; see the [tracking
bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1437065).

## Bug 1422043: Lazy entry stub generation

The previous bug resolution came with an important memory issue: every exported
function now generates a rather big chunk of code for the JIT entry, having an
impact on the memory occupied by the code itself. This would be fine in most
situations where the number of exported functions is generally low. But when
the wasm module exports a Table (think of the equivalent of a C++ function
table with signature checks), we have to assume that every single function,
including those not explicitly exported, needs entry stubs. Indeed, each
function can be eventually called through the Table, after calls to
[WebAssembly.Table.set](http://webassembly.github.io/spec/js-api/index.html#dom-table-set).
In fact, the existing code already suffered from this because of the
interpreter entries, but it had been largely amplified by the much larger JIT
entry stubs.

To fix this, we've decided to lazily generate all the entry stubs for functions
exported through a table. That is, if a function is *explicitly* exported, its
stubs will be generated at wasm compile time, but other functions won't have
stubs yet. If a non-exported function is called through a Table, we'll generate
the entry stubs the first time it is called. This involves some fun
interactions with our [tiered
compilation](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/01/making-webassembly-even-faster-firefoxs-new-streaming-and-tiering-compiler/)
mechanism, which can compile functions and create new entry stubs in the
background while the running thread will generate lazy ones.

Not only this fixed the memory regression introduced by bug 1319203, but it
actually made the situation even better than the baseline, because we didn't
need to generate those interpreter entries for table-exported functions by
default anymore:

Since it's not entirely readable from the chart: after the patches, the
AngryBots and ZenGarden entry stubs memory usages went down to respectively 262
and 362 KB. This was also a relatively huge win in compilation times, but on
such a low scale that it didn't make a huge difference on total compile time.

## Bug 1447591: Remove wasm::BinaryToText

WebAssembly is a binary format, and there is an equivalent human-readable and
debuggable text format: the WebAssembly Text format, or *WAT* format. While
SpiderMonkey once directly produced WAT for display in C++, it's now easier for
[debugger.html](https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html) to do so in JS.
This also made the mapping between bytecode offsets and text offsets (source
maps) more consistent with the display, and it could be useful in other places
where this project is being used. Recently after confirming that the C++
implementation wasn't used anymore, I was able to remove it. It's not every day
that you get a net loss of around 5,500 lines of code, which is always nice:
less code means fewer bugs and less maintenance burden, especially when the code
is dead.

## Bug 1445272 / 1450261: Implement basic `anyref` support

A new proposal has been made to the WebAssembly specification committee a few
months ago: to add [reference
types](https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types) to the type system.
Reference types are a new way to represent a reference to any *host* values. In
a Web environment, this means being capable of playing with JavaScript values
within WebAssembly. This is a huge difference with the existing type system,
which only contains primitive types: integers represented on 32 or 64 bits,
IEEE754 floating-point numbers represented on 32 or 64 bits. This is also a
first step for implementing [garbage
collection](http://github.com/webassembly/gc) (GC) integration within
WebAssembly: since these reference values have been allocated on the GC heap in
JavaScript, they need to be traced during wasm execution.

The basic implementation of this feature in the first bug allows one to use a
new type, called `anyref`, as part of a function's signature or in local
variables, be it in a function definition or an imported function. This allows
using JS variables within wasm and pass them around to other JS functions. The
second bug implemented the capability to read and write `anyref` values in wasm
Globals [1]. Since Globals can be manipulated outside of the wasm Module thanks
to their JS API, and garbage collections can happen at any time in JS, we
needed to implement GC barriers to make sure that the stored value would not be
marked as unused during tracing. There is good literature explaining why these
barriers are needed and what they do, so I will not expand too much on the
topic.

Here's an example of usage according to latest spec drafts (and therefore
subject to change for now):

```lisp
(module
    (func $alert (import "env" "alert") (param anyref))
    (global $global_ref (mut anyref) (ref.null anyref))
    (func (export "set_and_alert") (param $param anyref) (result anyref)
        ;; Put the previous value of $global_ref on the virtual value stack.
        get_global $global_ref
        ;; Get the argument anyref value and store it in $global_ref.
        get_local $param
        set_global $global_ref
        ;; Call the $alert method with the argument anyref value.
        get_local $param
        call $alert
        ;; The previous value of $global_ref is still on the stack and will be
        ;; returned.
    )
)
```

*Example of wasm text format using `anyref`.*

```js
(async function() {
    let { instance } = await WebAssembly.instantiate(wasmBinary, {
        env: {
            alert(obj) {
                alert(`Hello, ${obj.name}!`);
            }
        }
    });
    console.log(instance.exports.set_and_alert({
        name: 'world',
        secretVal: 42
    }));
    // alerts "Hello, world!", logs null

    console.log(JSON.stringify(instance.exports.set_and_alert({
        name: 'there'
    })));
    // alerts "Hello, there!", logs { name: 'world!', secretVal: 42 }
})();
```

*Example of JavaScript using the module defined above, passing JS values and
reading them from WebAssembly.*

This is a very preliminary prototype and it might change in the next few
months. If you feel adventurous, you can try it on Firefox Nightly by setting
the `about:config` pref `javascript.options.wasm_gc` to `true`; note that we
haven't fully hooked this up to garbage collection yet, so your experimentation
might occasionally throw out-of-memory exceptions. In any case, if you see
something, [say
something](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&component=Javascript%3A%20Web%20Assembly).

Say you are a compiler developer, and you would like to port your language to
WebAssembly, and your language uses a GC. At the moment, the only way you can
do this is by compiling your garbage collector to WebAssembly, and it would be
backed by the wasm Module's memory. This works, but it won't be very efficient.
Plus, there's already a very efficient, solidly tested, constantly improving
garbage collector in your browser that uses all the possible dirty low-level
tricks known to mankind, which is the GC being used for JavaScript. What if we
could give you access to the garbage collector directly? Then you'd just need
to give a way to define structures, and then could use a set of opcodes to
allocate them, read and write fields on them, etc. At the moment, the reference
types proposal only allows you to move garbage-collected values around. There's
also code in Firefox Nightly to experiment with defining your own data
structures and using them, but it is very very early. If you're interested in
following us implementing more parts, this [tracking
issue](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1444925) might be of
interest.

## Future work

There is still much more work to be done on the implementation of WebAssembly
in Spidermonkey, to implement other new proposals, to make it faster, or to
have even better generated code.
